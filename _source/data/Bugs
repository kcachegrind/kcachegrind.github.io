= Wish Items

If you have wishes for KCachegrind, please give them also a Wiki page.
I will regularly look up the Wiki pages and insert comments.

You can have a look at things to be integrated into
[[roadmap/TodoCallgrind Callgrind]] and
[[roadmap/TodoKCG KCachegrind]] in the near future.


== Wishes of myself:

* Support GProf, ... as profiling source 
* Data structure profiling (e.g. function foo wrote 5234x into data structure bar.value). 
* More events from cachegrind: TLB misses, page faults...
