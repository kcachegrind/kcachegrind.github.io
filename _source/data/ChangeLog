= 13.3.04: Calltree 0.9.7

the current stack trace, and current event counters. You can request
zeroing of counters, dumps and kill the processes.

and dump format description).

= 26.9.03: KCachegrind 0.4.4

Bug fix release.
* Corrected calculation of inclusive cost of cycles.
* Better drawing of cycles in the Call-Graph-View.
* Inclusion of [ContribPython hotshot2cachegrind]. For information
on usage, see the comment on top of the script.

= 8.9.03: KCachegrind 0.4.3

This is a cleanup release.
* Compiles with QT 3.0 again (e.g. RedHat 8.0).
* Some Style Guide Fixes merged back from the KDE CVS Branch of KCachegrind (to come
with KDE 3.2).
* Removed the "Cum." title from column headers. In fact, "inclusive cost" is shown here,
and not the aggregating self costs from the top as in GProf tables.
* Lists now have a maximum entry number option instead of minimum cost limit. And the last entry shows the number of functions skipped in the list.
* Source directories for the Source View are related to ELF objects now (in the configure
dialog). This is needed for KCachegrind to be able to show the right source sometimes.
* The Part View is (almost) fully functional now. Selecting profile parts wasn't possible
before.
* Treemap keyboard navigation and selection reworked. Right clicking now selects
the item below first.

= 28.8.03: KCachegrind 0.4.2.

Crash fix release.
* Don't crash on Profile data Reload when the Call Graph View is visible.
* This is the version initially imported into KDE CVS for KDE 3.2.

= 14.8.03. KCachegrind 0.4.1.
