= The basic Data Model for Profile Data

== Cost Entities

Cost counts of event types (like ''L2 Misses'') are attributed to cost entities, which are items with relationship to source code or data structures of a given program.
Cost entities not only can be simple code or data positions, but also
position tupels. E.g., a call has a source and a target, or a data address can have a data type and an code position where its allocation has happened.

The cost entities known to KCachegrind are listed
[[GUICostEntities here]].

== Event Types

Arbitrary event types can be specified in the profile data by
giving them a name. Their cost related to a cost entity is a 64-bit integer.

Event types whose costs are specified in a profile data file are called
''real'' events. Additionally, one can specify formulas for event types
calculated from real events, which are called ''inherited'' events.
