This is the homepage of the profiling tool '''Callgrind'''
and the profile data visualization '''KCachegrind'''.

Callgrind uses runtime instrumentation via the [[Valgrind]]
framework for its cache simulation and call-graph generation.
This way, even shared libraries and
dynamically opened plugins can be profiled.
The data files generated by Callgrind can be loaded into KCachegrind for
browsing the performance results. But there is also a command line tool
in the package to get ASCII reports from data files
without the need to use KCachegrind.

The format of Callgrind output is
documented [[CallgrindFormat here]]. With
[[Converters conversion scripts]],
KCachegrind is able to visualize output of other profilers like
<a href="http://oprofile.sf.net">OProfile</a>,
a system-wide profiler for Linux
using statistical sampling with hardware performance counters.
There also exist converters for profiling output of Python, PHP and
PERL.

= Current Releases

* KCachegrind 0.7.4 (includes qcachegrind, just needs Qt4 or Qt5)
* for Callgrind, install Valgrind 3.8.x

= Requirements

* Callgrind: part of Valgrind (supports Linux on x86, amd64, arm7, ...)
* KCachegrind:
** Libraries and development files for KDE 4.4 or higher
** Commands 'dot' (GraphViz) for call graph, and 'objdump' (BinUtils) for assembler view (these are runtime requirements, not needed for compilation)
* QCachegrind (included in KCachegrind sources)
** Qt5 or Qt4.x (x>=4) or higher
** 'dot' binary for call graph and 'objdump' binary for annotated machine code


= News

* 2013, April 5: [[Download KCachegrind 0.7.4]]
* 27.9.05: [[Download KCachegrind 0.4.6]] (for KDE3/Trinity)
* 16.4.04: Callgrind Format Specification [[CallgrindFormat online]]
