<small><i>[Mostly excerpts from some mailing lists. Please send me an
EMail for your own external reference or if you want your citation removed.]</i></small>

* "... kcachegrind is a marvelous tool by the way, try it if you can.
Too bad it requires KDE3, or we'd be using it at work everyday ..."
(<a href="http://www.freetype.org/pipermail/devel/2004-June/010830.html">Link</a>)

* "... finally took some time to install kcachegrind. What a wonderful tool. I finally understood how to use all those lists and numbers to actually make stuff faster. Kcachegrind visualizes the information very good, especially the source code view totally rocks."
(<a href="http://www.advogato.org/person/kristian/diary.html?start=18">Link</a>)

* "... I am also doing some profiling analysis on the test programs using
valgrind/cachegrind/kcachegrind combination. This combination gives a
really good profiling tool."
(<a href="http://cairographics.org/pipermail/cairo/2003-June/000104.html">Link</a>)

* "...  Use cachegrind with the excellent visualisation tool kcachegrind."
