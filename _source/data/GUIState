The Visualisation state of a KCachegrind window includes:
* the primary and secondary event type choosen for display,
* the function grouping
(used in the Function Profile list and entity coloring),
* the profile parts whose costs are to be included in visualization,
* an active cost entity (e.g. a function selected from the
function profile dockable),
* a selected cost entity.

This state influences visualizations.

Visualizations always are shown for one, the active, cost entity.
When a given visualization is not appropriate for a cost entity,
it is disabled (e.g. when selecting an ELF object in the group list
by double-clicking, source annotation for an ELF object make no sense).

E.g. for an active function, the callee list shows all the functions called
from the active one. One can select one of these functions without making
it active. If the call-graph is shown nearside, it will automatically
select the same function.
