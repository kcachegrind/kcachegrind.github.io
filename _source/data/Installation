= Installation of Callgrind

Unpack Callgrind into a directory and install it by running
 
  ./configure
  make
  make install (as "root" if needed)

This will find your Valgrind installation path and copy the new tool nearside.
The script "callgrind" is supplied to run valgrind with the callgrind tool.
It is the same as running "valgrind --tool=callgrind ...".


= Installation of KCachegrind 

== Requirements

* Qt 3.x (with development package)
* KDE libraries (kdelibs)
from KDE 3.0.x or KDE 3.1.x or KDE 3.2.x (with development package)

KCachegrind will call some command line tools in the background.
These are a runtime requirement, i.e. KCachegrind will warn you 
at runtime if they are not found. Follwoing packages should be installed:
* binutils. Command 'objdump' is used as disassembler for the Assembler View.
* graphviz. Command 'dot' is used for graph layouting in the Callgraph View.

== Compilation and Installation

Make sure that you have installed KDE 3.x with according development packages.
If you want to install KCachegrind in a system wide manner, get the global
installation directory of KDE by running

  kde-config --prefix

Unpack the KCachegrind sources into a directory and install KCachegrind by running (supposing /opt/kde3 as your global KDE installation directory)

  ./configure --prefix=/opt/kde3
  make
  make install (as "root" if needed)

If you don't specify a prefix to "configure", KCachegrind will be installed into /usr/local/kde. If you don't have root permission, choose e.g. $HOME/kde as prefix. In this case, you have to set KDEDIR=$HOME/kde additionally. Put $HOME/kde/bin into your path, too.

Simple running "kcachegrind" should open an toplevel window with no trace loaded.
