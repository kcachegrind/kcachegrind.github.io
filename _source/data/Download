= License

Callgrind and KCachegrind are open source software, and licensed under
GPL V2. More details can be found [[License here]].

= Precompiled Binaries

KCachegrind 0.7.x is available with KDE 4.x.
If your distribution includes KDE, chances are good that you already have
it installed, or that a binary package is provided.

Callgrind is merged into Valgrind since version 3.1.

While QCachegrind can be easily compiled on Mac OS-X and Windows, there
currently are no precompiled packages or installers available. You need
to compile it from source.

If you know other sources, or have corrections, please send me an EMail.
