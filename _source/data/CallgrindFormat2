== 2.1 Grammar

A Callgrind profile data file is an expression of
"ProfileDataFile" in the following grammar
("+" means "at least once", "?" optional).

 ProfileDataFile := FormatVersion? Creator? PartData*

 FormatVersion := "version:" Space* Number "\n"

 Creator := "creator:" NoNewLineChar* "\n"

 PartData := (HeaderLine "\n")+ (BodyLine "\n")+

 HeaderLine := <i>(empty line)</i>
  | ('#' NoNewLineChar*)
  | PartDetail
  | Description
  | EventSpecification
  | CostLineDef

 PartDetail := TargetCommand | TargetID

 TargetCommand := "cmd:" Space* NoNewLineChar*

 TargetID := ("pid"|"thread"|"part") ":" Space* Number

 Description := "desc:" Space* Name Space* ":" NoNewLineChar*

 EventSpecification := "event:" Space* Name InheritedDef? LongNameDef?

 InheritedDef := "=" InheritedExpr

 InheritedExpr := Name
  | Number Space* ("*" Space*)? Name
  | InheritedExpr Space* "+" Space* InheritedExpr

 LongNameDef := ":" NoNewLineChar*

 CostLineDef := "events:" Space* Name (Space+ Name)*
  | "positions:" "instr"? (Space+ "line")?

 BodyLine := <i>(empty line)</i>
  | ('#' NoNewLineChar*)
  | CostLine
  | PositionSpecification
  | AssoziationSpecification

 CostLine := SubPositionList Costs?

 SubPositionList := (SubPosition+ Space+)+

 SubPosition := Number | "+" Number | "-" Number | "*"

 Costs := (Number Space+)+

 PositionSpecification := Position "=" Space* PositionName

 Position := CostPosition | CalledPosition

 CostPosition := "ob" | "fl" | "fi" | "fe" | "fn"

 CalledPosition := " "cob" | "cfl" | "cfn"

 PositionName := ( "(" Number ")" )? (Space* NoNewLineChar* )?

 AssoziationSpecification := CallSpezification
  | JumpSpecification

 CallSpecification := CallLine "\n" CostLine

 CallLine := "calls=" Space* Number Space+ SubPositionList

 JumpSpecification := ...

 Space := " " | "\t"

 Number := HexNumber | (Digit)+

 Digit := "0" | ... | "9"

 HexNumber := "0x" (Digit | HexChar)+

 HexChar := "a" | ... | "f" | "A" | ... | "F"

 Name = Alpha (Digit | Alpha)*

 Alpha = "a" | ... | "z" | "A" | ... | "Z"

 NoNewLineChar := <i>all characters without "\n"</i>


== 2.2 Description of Header Lines

The header has an arbitrary number of lines of the format
"key: value".
Possible <i>key</i> values for the header are:

* <tt>version: number</tt> [Callgrind]<br>
This is used to distinguish future profile data file formats.
A version of 1 is supposed to be upwards
compatible with the Cachegrind format.
Optional. If not given, defaults to version 1.
Otherwise it has to be the first header line.

* <tt>creator: string</tt> [Callgrind]<br>
Information about the creator of this file, i.e. the
profile tool or conversion script.
Optional.

* <tt>pid: process id</tt> [Callgrind]<br>
This specifies the process ID of the supervised
application for which this profile was generated.
Optional.

* <tt>cmd: program name + args</tt> [Cachegrind]<br>
This specifies the full command line of the supervised
application for which this profile was generated.
Optional.

* <tt>part: number</tt> [Callgrind]<br>
This specifies a sequentially running number for
profile dumps belonging to the same profile run of an application,
starting at 1.
Optional.

* <tt>desc: type: value</tt> [Cachegrind]<br>
This specifies various information for this dump.
For some types, the semantic is defined, but any
description type is allowed. Unknown types are
ignored.
