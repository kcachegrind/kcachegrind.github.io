Valgrind is a runtime instrumentation framework for Linux/x86.
It can supervise runs of unmodified binaries in arbitrary ways.
The Homepage is 
<a href=http://developer.kde.org/~sewardj/>Valgrind</a>.

Valgrind can be extended by using a plugin system, so called skins.
Calltree is such a skin. Other skins I have written:

* Memaccess.
<a href="/memaccess-0.0.2.tar.gz">memaccess-0.0.2.tar.gz</a> (105 KB).
<br>
This seperates the instrumentation
for memory accesses into an own skin. When an event happens, application
supplied handlers can be called. For more information, see the README file
included in the package.
