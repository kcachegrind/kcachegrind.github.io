<h2> 28.5.03</h2>
Calltree Skin V 0.9.1
Bug fix release. 
<ul>
<li>Fixed a packaging mistake. I should have used "make distcheck" earlier ;-) 
<li>Runs with Valgrind V 1.9.6. Because of a skin API change, calltree previously did compile with V 1.9.6, but didn't run. 
<li>Fixed failed assertion with --trace-jump=yes: Jumps can happen between different functions with long_jmp/C++ exceptions. 
</ul>
<p>
<h2> 24.5.03</h2>
Calltree Skin V 0.9.0
<ul>
<li>Compiles both with Valgrind 1.9.6 and current Valgrind CVS. 
<li>Compile fixes for GCC 3.3. 
<li>Added option --dump-instr=yes to include trace information on instruction level. This needs a new version of KCachegrind to be useful. Stay tuned! 
<li>Added option --trace-jump=yes to include trace information for (conditional) jumps inside of a function. 
</ul>
<p>
<h2> 16.4.03</h2>
Calltree Skin V 0.2.95.
<ul>
<li>Fixed a dumb configure error of 0.2.94. Added some HTML documation. 
</ul>
<p>
<h2> 15.4.03</h2>
Calltree Skin V 0.2.94.
<ul>
<li>Some speedups and small bug fixes. Compiles with V 1.9.5. 
</ul>
<p>
<h2> 5.4.03</h2>
KCachegrind 0.3b
<ul>
<li>Real cost types are drawn in different colors in the graphic cost bars now. This is especially useful to see the partitioning of real costs in a virtual type. 
<li>Cost type bars are shown in the treemaps. 
<li>The flat profile shows call counts now. This allows for call count order. 
<li>Cycle detection is switchable with a toolbar button. For GUI application, sometimes it's useful to switch cycle detection off, even if there are some visualization errors with recursive calls. 
<li>New toolbar button to show "expanded" percentage costs. If this switch is off, all costs are shown relative to the total application cost (in call lists/source view). If switched on, the costs are relative to the function cost, thus "expanded". 
<li>The treemap now shows a black hash pattern on areas where sub items are to small to draw. 
Lot of optimisations allover. 
</ul>
<p>
Calltree Skin 0.2.93 for Valgrind 1.9.4 
<ul>
<li>Reordered event type order for better visualisation with KCachegrind 0.3b
<li>Small bug fixes
</ul>
<p>
<h2> 2.4.03</h2>
Calltree Skin 0.2.92 for Valgrind 1.9.4
<ul>
<li>All bugs with multithreaded apps should be fixed now. Missing for version 0.99: Regression tests, docu, and performance :-) 
</ul>
<p>
<h2> 31.3.03</h2>
Calltree Skin 0.2.91 for Valgrind 1.9.4
<ul>
<li>Bugs with --fn-skip=xxx are fixed. For multithreaded apps, it only works with --dump-threads=yes for now. 
</ul>
<p>
<h2> 17.3.03</h2>
Calltree Skin 0.2.90 for Valgrind 1.9.4
<ul>
<li>This is the 2nd prerelease for the calltree rewrite. Warning: Bugs with multithreaded apps still not fixed! A lot of new command line options, and UserRequests. 
</ul>
<p>
<h2> 27.2.03</h2>
Calltree Skin 0.2d for Valgrind 1.9.x
<ul>
<li>Bug fix: Use 64 bit for cycle cost 
</ul>
<p>
Calltree Skin 0.3pre for Valgrind 1.9.x
<ul>
<li>This is a prerelease of a rewritten calltree skin. Warning: Multithreading is buggy! 
</ul>
<p>
<h2> 6.2.03</h2>
KCachegrind 0.3a
<ul>
<li>This is a bugfix release. It's compiling both with KDE 3.0.x and KDE 3.1.x libraries. 
<li>Compile fixes for KDE 3.0.x. Tested. 
<li>Fix for loading of traces from other directories. 
<li>Fix to always select a trace type. 
</ul>
<p>
<h2> 27.1.03</h2>
Calltree Skin 0.2c for Valgrind 1.9.x
<ul>
<li>A simple port of 0.2b to a independent skin (plugin) for Valgrind 1.9.x. 
<li>No patching of valgrind sources required; a binary Valgrind installation is enough. 
</ul>
<p>
<h2> 29.11.02</h2>
KCachegrind 0.3
<ul>
<li>Compiles with KDE 3.0.5. 
<li>Recursive handling corrected: Cycle detection and handling. 
<li>Internal cleanup: Cost types aren't hardcoded any more (config missing) 
<li>Treemap widget: New Split Types (Recursive bisection, Columns, Rows) for more rectangular areas when there are many subitems. 
</ul>
<p>
<h2> 15.10.02</h2>
Calltree Patch 0.2b for Valgrind 1.0.4
<ul>
<li>Adjustments for Valgrind 1.0.4. Note: Valgrind 1.0.4 has a serious bugfix for debug info generated with GCC 3.x. This bugfix is very important the see the real function names in KCachegrind instead of 0x80xxxxxx. 
<li>No compile warnings with GCC 3.x any more 
<li>Now the "trigger:" line has the exact reason for a trace dump 
</ul>
<p>
<h2> 24.9.02</h2>
KCachegrind 0.2a
<ul>
<li>Compile fix for GCC 3.x and KDE 3.0.x 
<li>Optional TreeMap shading added (for even nicer screenshots!) 
<li>Minor GUI string fixes 
</ul>
<p>
<h2> 23.9.02</h2>
KCachegrind 0.2
<ul>
<li>Terminology similar to GProf. 
<li>Lot of What's this help added for all widgets in KCachegrind. 
<li>Added to Info tab: 'List of loaded parts' with function info per trace part. This also allows hiding parts to get e.g. only Thread1 profile parts for a multithreaded application. 
Graph rectangles are now optionally titled by name and cost, if available space allows this (see Screenshots!) 
<li>Many visualisation options added for the TreeMap widget, all available by a context menu. Most important: A mode to get real cost size proportions ('Skip incorrect border')! 
<li>Much improved automatic saving/loading of configuration and current program state options. Most options are stored on a profiled-command-basis. Quitting KCachegrind and starting it again with a trace of the same profiled program, gives you the same window layout and preselected funtion/group. 
<li>Toolbar buttons for Reload Trace/Force Cachegrind Dump added for some interactive control of a running profile from the GUI. 
<li>More distance information in the Coverage Tab. 
<li>And much more... 
</ul>
<p>
<h2> 14.9.02</h2>
Calltree Patch 0.2a for Valgrind 1.0.2
<ul>
<li>Improved multi-thread support. There's much less slowdown for single threaded programs while allowing multi-threading. 
<li>Option "--dump-threads=no|yes" added. Allows separate trace file generation per thread in multi-threaded programs. Default is one trace file for costs of all threads. 
<li>Added documentation in README.calltree: All about usage, additional options, trace format extension, changelog, some benchmark results, and technical details on the patch. 
</ul>
<p>
<h2> 11.9.02</h2>
KCachegrind 0.1d, Changes:
<ul>
<li>Update fix for Source 
<li>New config option: L1/L2 factor for CPU cycle estimation 
<li>New config option: Drawing Mode for Graphs 
<li>Able to load thread trace parts (produced by Calltree Patch 0.2 with multithreaded programs). 
</ul>
<p>
Calltree Patch 0.2 for Valgrind 1.0.2
<ul>
<li>Version 0.2 supports multi-threaded programs now. Unfortunately there's some overhead (10%) even for single-threaded programs at the moment, and the version is possible not very stable. So use 0.1e if you don't need it. For thread traces, the filename has appended "-tid" for costs in thread tid. 
</ul>
<p>
<h2> 10.9.02</h2>
Calltree Patch 0.1e for Valgrind 1.0.2
<ul>
<li>Bugfix for Segfault with indirect jumps in client code 
<li>Bugfix for correct dumping of inlined functions 
</ul>
<p>
<h2> 9.9.02</h2>
Calltree Patch 0.1d for Valgrind 1.0.2
<ul>
<li>Option --calltree=no to disable call-tracing. Needed to disable call-tree tracing for multithreaded programs, as that's not working at the moment. You get the original cachegrind behaviour (aside from compressed output). 
<li>Option --compress-strings=no to disable string compression in trace dumps. This produces more human readable trace output. 
<li>Atomic generation of trace part files. This is done by dumping to ".file" and renaming to "file" afterwards. 
</ul>
<p>
<h2> 6.9.02</h2>
KCachegrind 0.1c, Changes:
<ul>
<li>Should finally compile with KDE 3.0.x 
<li>Some Docu fix (at least no more errors) 
</ul>
<p>
Calltree Patch 0.1c for Valgrind 1.0.1
<ul>
<li>Failed assertions fixed (unmapping/CC type check) 
<li>vg_annotate can now load the traces 
</ul>
<p>
<h2> 4.9.02</h2>
KCachegrind 0.1b, Changes:
<ul>
<li>New calculated event type: CPU Cycle Estimation, selected on startup. 
<li>Distance column in Coverage lists: shows minimal stack frame distance to selected function. 
<li>Should compile with GCC 3.x now 
<li>Should compile with KDE 3.0.x now (Ships KWidgetAction) 
<li>Small GUI fixes 
<li>Searches recursively for source files now 
<li>Some usefull tips of the day added 
<li>German message translation 
<li>Reads trace files produced by original Cachegrind and Cachgrind with Calltree patch 0.1b (No previous Calltree patches supported !). 
</ul>
<p>
Calltree Patch 0.1b for Valgrind 1.0.1
<ul>
<li>Hopefully no malformed patch... 
<li>Option --cachedumps= renamed to --dumps= 
<li>Option --dumpat=function added to dump at function entry 
<li>Immediate dump forcable with "touch cachegrind.cmd" in cwd of a running cachegrind (the program must be running, not sleep!) 
<li>Creates traces with names 'cachegrind.out.pid.part' 
<li>Writes compressed traces (70% smaller than original cachegrind) 
</ul>
