<h2> Event Types</h2>
This list shows all cost types available
and the corresponding self and inclusive cost of the
current active function for that event type.
<p>
By choosing an event type from the list,
you change the type of costs shown 
all over KCachegrind to be the selected one.
<p>
<h2> Call Lists</h2>
These lists show calls to/from the current active function.
With ''all' callers/callees functions are meant which can
be reached in caller/callee direction, even when other functions are
inbetween.
<p>
Call list views include:
<ul>
<li>Direct Callers
<li>Direct Callees
<li>All Callers
<li>All Callees
</ul>
<p>
<h2> Maps</h2>
A treemap visualization of the primary event type, up or down the
call hierarchy. Each colored rectangle represents a function;
its size tries to be proportional to the cost spent
therein while the active function is running
(however, there are drawing constrains).
<p>
For the Caller Map, the graph shows the nested hierarchy of
all callers of the current activated function; for the
Callee Map, it shows the nested hierarchy of
all callees of the current activated function.
<p>
Appearance options can be found in the
in the context menu. To get exact size proportions,
choose 'Hide incorrect borders'. As this mode can be
<i>very</i> time consuming, you may want to limit
the maximum drawn nesting level before.
'Best' determinates the split direction for children
from the aspect ratio of the parent.
'Always Best' decides on remaining space for each sibling.
'Ignore Proportions' takes space for function name
drawing <i>before</i> drawing children. Note that
size proportions can get <i>heavily</i> wrong.
<p>
Keyboard navigation is available with the left/right arrow
keys for traversing siblings, and up/down arrow keys
to go a nesting level up/down.
'Return' activates the current item.
<p>
<h2> Call Graph</h2>
This view shows the call graph around the active function.
<p>
The shown cost is <b>only</b> the cost which is
spent while the active function was actually running;
i.e. the cost shown for main() - if it's visible - should
be the same as the cost of the active function, as that is
the part of inclusive cost of main() spent while the active
function was running.
<p>
For cycles, blue call arrows indicate that this is an
artificial call added for correct drawing which
actually never happened.
<p>
If the graph is larger than the widget area, an overview
panner is shown in one edge.
There are similar visualization options as for the
Call Treemap; the selected function is highlighted.
<p>
<h2> Annotations</h2>
<h3> Source Annotation</h3>
<p>
The annotated source list shows the
source lines of the current active function
together with (self) cost spent while executing the
code of a source line. If there was a call
from a source line, lines with details on the
call are inserted into the source: the
(inclusive) cost spent inside of the call,
the number of calls happening, and the call destination.
<p>
Select such a call information line to activate the
call destination.
<p>
<h3> Assembler Annotation</h3>
<p>
The annotated assembler list shows the
machine code instructions of the current selected
function together with (self) cost spent while
executing an instruction. If this is a <i>CALL</i>
instruction, lines with details on the
call are inserted into the source:
the (inclusive) cost spent inside of the call,
the number of calls happening, and the call destination.
<p>
The disassembler output shown is generated with
the 'objdump' utility from the 'binutils' package.
<p>
Select such a call information line to activate the
call destination.
