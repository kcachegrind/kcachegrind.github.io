<h3> Flat Profile</h3>
<p>
The flat profile contains a group list and a function
list. The group list contains all groups where cost
is spent in, depending on the chosen group type.
The group list is hidden when grouping is switched off.
<p>
The function list contains the functions of the
selected group (or all functions if grouping is switched off),
ordered by some column, e.g. inclusive or self costs spent therein.
There is a maximal number of functions shown in the list, which is
configurable in Settings/Configure KCachegrind.
<p>
<h3> Parts Overview</h3>
<p>
In a profile run, multiple profile data files can be produced,
which can be loaded together into KCachegrind.
The Parts Overview dockable shows these, horizontally ordered
according creation time; the rectangle sizes are proportional to the
cost spent in the parts. You can select one or several
parts to constrain the costs shown in the other KCachegrind views to these parts only.
<p>
The parts are further subdivided: there is a partitioning and an inclusive cost split mode:
<ul>
<li>Partitioning: You see the
partitioning into groups for a profile data part, according to
the group type selected. E.g. if ELF object groups are
selected, you see colored rectangles for each
used ELF object (shared library or executable), sized
according to the cost spent therein.
<li>Inclusive Cost Split: A rectangle showing the inclusive
cost of the current active function in the part is shown.
This again is split up to show inclusive costs of its callees.
</ul>
<p>
<h3> Call Stack</h3>
<p>
This is a purely fictional 'most probable' call stack.
It is built up by starting with the current active
function and adds the callers/callees with highest cost
at the top and to bottom.
<p>
The <i>Cost</i> and <i>b>Calls</i> columns show the cost used
for all calls from the function in the line above.
